# ALX School Project: Zero Day
## Step 0: Create a GitHub Account
If you don't already have a GitHub account, create one for free [here](https://github.com/)
.

## Step 1: Create a Personal Access Token on GitHub
To access your repositories and authenticate yourself, you need to create a Personal Access Token on GitHub. Follow this tutorial to create a token.

## Step 2: Update Your Profile on the Intranet
Update your Intranet profile by adding your GitHub username. This is necessary for the checker to correct your work.

## Step 3: Create Your First Repository
Using the GitHub website, create your first repository:

* Name: *alx-zero_day*
* Description: "I'm now an ALX student, this is my first repository as a full-stack engineer"
* Public repository
* No README, .gitignore, or license

## Step 4: Open the Sandbox
In the web terminal of the sandbox, enter the following commands:

```
# Clone your repository
git clone https://{YOUR_PERSONAL_TOKEN}@github.com/{YOUR_USERNAME}/alx-zero_day.git

# Replace {YOUR_PERSONAL_TOKEN} with your token from step 1
# Replace {YOUR_USERNAME} with your username from step 0 and 1

```
## Step 6: Create the README.md and Push the Modifications
In the web terminal, enter the following commands:

```
# Navigate to the repository directory
cd alx-zero_day/

# Create the README.md file
echo 'My first readme' > README.md

# Update your git identity
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
git config --global user.name "Your Name"

# Add the file, commit the changes, and push to the remote server
git add .
git commit -m 'My first commit'
git push

```

Congratulations, you've pushed your first file to your first repository of your first ALX School project! Check your repository on GitHub to confirm everything is in order.
